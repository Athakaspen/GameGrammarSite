# Japanese Learning FAQ

## How to get started

It can be overwhelming when you get started so here's our recommendation of how to get started (Use tags mentioned in #bot_spam):

### 1: Learn the Kana

The first thing you should do is to learn the Japanese syllabaries aka the Kana. This includes Hiragana and Katakana but not Kanji. It will be very important to know the Kana right from the start since many resources online (GameGrammar included) will often assume you know at least Kana. More info [here](##Kana).

### 2: Learn grammar

Grammar is the foundation on which the language is built. Learning basic grammar can be an extremely powerful tool when you first try to wrap your head around how a language works. You may feel some resistance since it sounds boring to learn about grammar but we encourage you to do it. It can be very rewarding to learn grammar and thereby understand the system behind the language. Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed at first and feel free to ask whenever you have questions. More info [here](##Grammar). 

### 3: Learn vocab

This should of course be started in tandem with point 2 since learning only grammar and no vocab to use the grammar with can feel a bit vacuous. If grammar is the foundation then vocab are the building blocks with which you build the house. To be comfortable understanding any language you need to learn a few thousand words. This may seem like a tall order but, you can do it! More info [here](##Vocab).

### 4: Reading/Listening

You should get into the habit of getting a lot of input. This can be done in the form of listening or reading. You need to fill your brain with enough information about the language before you'll be able to reproduce it. More info [here](##Input).

## Kana

Japanese is mainly written using 3 different writing systems. **Hiragana**, **Katakana** and **Kanji**. Since Kanji is a big topic by itself, we'll just focus on the Kana, which means Hiragana and Katakana. 

Both of these scripts are basically syllabaries, which means that they consists of a set of characters where each describes a syllable/sound. This also means that unlike the English alphabet, the Kana are almost completely phonetic. In other words, if you see a Kana character, you'll know how it sounds. 

Katakana is basically a copy of Hiragana, just that they look different and are used slightly differently. For each Hiragana there exists a corresponding Katakana. For example, this is the Hiragana for the sound /a/ あ and this is the corresponding Katakana ア. (Note that this /a/ is like the a in the British pronunciation of "father".)

Now, let's talk about where you can learn the Kana:
You can read about the writing system overall in this [Wiki article](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/the-writing-system/).

We recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/_wZHqOghvSs) as it shows you how to write and pronounce each Kana.
There are also Tofugu articles for each set. [Hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) and [Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/).

## Grammar

Grammar can seem dauting at first but it's not all that bad. Luckily a lot of kind people are providing free grammar resources online. You're on the server of a few of them actually. With that said, GameGrammar has its very own series about grammar called Japanese101 and you can check it out on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smwe35H6w7A).

There's also a handful of very good grammar guides online. These are the 3 most popular ones:

### [Tae Kim's guide](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar)

 A popular and well made grammar guide that walks you through from very beginner to a upper intermediate understanding of grammar. In terms of JLPT, you should be around N3 after finishing it, maybe higher.

### [Imabi](https://www.imabi.net/) 

An insanely extensive grammar reference. Written and updated by many different people, it goes from the basics all the way to advanced topics like classical Japanese. This is probably the extensive guide you can find for free online. It has a tendency to use more linguistic jargon though so be wary of that.
 
### [Wasabi Grammar Reference](https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-grammar/wasabis-online-japanese-grammar-reference/) 

A slightly newer grammar reference that is still being added to. What sets it apart is its use of illustrations to help explain concepts.

## Vocab

Learning vocab is a very long process but luckily an easy one. These days there's tons of apps to help you with it. Most of them use a process called SRS (Spaced Repetition System) where flashcards will be shown to you at specific intervals which are determined by how well you knew the card. The most famous such program is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
It's also available for Android and iOS (though the iOS version isn't free). 

Another famous SRS is [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/)

If you wanna get started with learning vocab, the recommended thing is to grab some sort of beginner vocab deck from a pre-made list or create one yourself. You can find tons of guides on how to create your own cards just the way you want them in Anki on Youtube. Generally, if you create flashcards from the things you actually encountered while learning, they have a better chance of sticking in your mind.

We also have these lists for the games we play on stream:

[Ace Attorney](https://jisho.hlorenzi.com/list/rkE43D) and 
[Ni no Kuni](https://jisho.hlorenzi.com/list/-RdTuL)

You can download these and import them into Anki if you want to.

## Input

Getting input is very important. It's the way you train your brain to understand the language and eventually to reproduce what  you've heard/seen. What's important is that you have to understand at least some of what you listen to or read. You don't have to understand it immediately but rather, if you can make sense of about 75% through the use of dictionaries and google, then you'll be able to get very good practice out of a reading or listening material. What you use is basically up to you, as long as you do it regularly and it is somewhat appropriate for your level. 

### Reading

Reading has loads of advantages. Firstly, you get to pick your own pace. Secondly, you can use visual cues such as Kanji you might recognize. Manga can be a good start for many since the provided pictures can help figuring out what's  going on. Here's a list of materials that might help you:

* [Watanoc](http://watanoc.com/): Articles about Japan with audio (N5-N4)
* Manga: 少女週末旅行 (Girls' Last Tour), よつばと！(Yotsubato)
* [Tadoku](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/free-books-en/): Children stories
* [Hukumusume](http://hukumusume.com/douwa/En/jap/index.html): Japanese classical stories.
*[NHK Easy News](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/): Simplified news at  (N3-ish)

### Listening

Listening practice can be had on Youtube, Netflix, Twitch and many other places. There are also podcasts out there that you can give a go. Some of our recommendations are

* ひいきびいき: A podcast that ended a while ago but has over 200 episodes with all sorts of topics.(Can be hard to find these days) 
* [Muggles' Giggles](http://mugglesgiggles.com/wordpress/): If you're at all into Harry Potter and translation, give this one a go. 2 bilingual people go through the Japanese HP and talk about what they think of the translation.
